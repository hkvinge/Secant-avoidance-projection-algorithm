# The secant avoidance projection algorithm

The secant avoidance projection (SAP) algorithm is a secant-based dimensionality reduction algorithm. 
Very roughly it searches for projections that preserve the spatial relations among points in a data set "well".
In this case, "well" means that the projections preserves the secants between points.

This repository contains CUDA code for the SAP algorithm.
At the moment I am still uploading and restructuring the code. I expect everything to be uploaded 
and in good shape by mid-October 2018.
